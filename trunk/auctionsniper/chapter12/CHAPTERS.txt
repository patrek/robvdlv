Chapter 11 - Passing the First Test

    In which we write test infrastructure to drive our non-existent application,
    so that we can make the first test fail. We repeatedly fail the test and fix
    symptoms, until we have a minimal working application that passes the first
    test.
    
Chapter 12 - Getting Ready to Bid

    In which we write an end-to-end test so that we can make the sniper bid in
    an auction. We start to interpret the messages in the auction protocol and
    discover some new classes in the process. We write our first unit tests and
    then refactor out to a helper class.
